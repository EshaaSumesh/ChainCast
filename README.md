# ChainCast :Crypto Price Predictor
ChainCast is a data science project that leverages machine learning to analyze and predict blockchain trends. It covers the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and interactive visualization — showcasing how predictive analytics can provide insights into cryptocurrency and blockchain activity.

## Features
- Multi-coin support from dynamic datasets (25+ crypto assets)
- Technical feature engineering (MA, volatility, return)
- Trained regression model using RandomForestRegressor
- Fully interactive dashboard with input sliders and live predictions
- Plotly-powered visualizations: price trends, correlation, feature importances
- Professional UI with theme customization (dark mode, monospace font)
- Session history tracking for forecast comparisons

---
## Technologies Used
- Python 3.9+
- Streamlit – UI and dashboard framework
- scikit-learn – Regression modeling
- pandas / NumPy – Data processing
- plotly / seaborn / matplotlib – Visual analytics
- joblib – Model serialization

## How It Works

### 1. Data

Each cryptocurrency has an individual CSV file under `/crypto-coins/`, containing historical pricing data (OHLCV).

### 2. Feature Engineering

The model uses:
- MA_7: 7-day Moving Average
- MA_30: 30-day Moving Average
- Volatility: 7-day Standard Deviation
- Daily Return: Percent change between days

### 3. Modeling
A RandomForestRegressor is trained on user-defined features and saved as `crypto_regression_model.pkl`.
### 4. Deployment
The interactive app (`app.py`) allows the user to:
- Select a coin and date range
- View price trends and charts
- Adjust input parameters
- Predict the next closing price instantly
